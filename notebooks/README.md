# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks implementing a modular machine learning pipeline for backorder prediction, spanning data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Contents

- **Part_1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**  
  Handles data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, class imbalance analysis, and preparation of a model-ready dataset.

- **Part_2_Model_Development.ipynb**  
  Develops and trains multiple supervised machine learning models, including baseline and ensemble approaches, with hyperparameter tuning.

- **Part_3_Model_Evaluation.ipynb**  
  Evaluates trained models using business-relevant metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and interprets results using confusion matrices.
